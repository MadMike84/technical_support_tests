technical_support_tests
=======================
This repository is used for interviewing our potential technical support engineers :-)
Checkout the code and create a new branch with your name:
# git co -b candidate/YOUR_NAME

From then on you can work on your branch and commit to it.
Please fix the following tests so that the command:

# bundle exec rspec spec

returns no Failures anymore.

Thanks and have fun with ruby and rspec! ;-)
