technical_support_tests
=======================
This repository is used to test the coding skills of our potential technical support engineers :-)
Checkout the code and create a new branch with your name:
# git co -b candidate/YOUR_NAME

From then on you can work on your branch and commit to it.

Here's your exercise.
Please fix the following tests so that the command:

# bundle exec rspec spec

returns no Failures anymore.

Once you're done you can publish the changes with the following command:
# git push origin candidate/YOUR_NAME
