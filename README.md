technical_support_tests
=======================
This repository is used to test the coding skills of our potential technical support engineers :-)

The directory structure is as follows:

-models // contains the implementations that need to be created by you

-spec   // contains the tests that need to be run

Checkout the code and create a new branch with your name:
# git co -b candidate/YOUR_NAME

From then on you can work on your branch and commit to it.

Here's your exercise.
Please create an implementation for the following tests so that all tests are green.

You can start the tests by running the followig command:
# bundle exec rspec spec

Once you're done you can publish the changes with the following command:
# git push origin candidate/YOUR_NAME
